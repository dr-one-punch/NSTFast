This is working as streamlit was designed, the code reruns from top to bottom after every action, 
in that new run it will only have access to the latest action. In your example after pushing button 2 
it doesn remember pushing button 1 before that.

if use a button inside a button and press the inside button it forgets the external button and hence
all the program runs again and we are stuck :(
